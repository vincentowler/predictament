        <h2>Prediction Tournament Instructions</h2>
        Thanks for letting us know a bit about yourself. We’ll now ask you to
        make some predictions about other people. We’ll display their profile
        information and based on this information, ask you to:
        <ol>
          <li>
            You have 30 tokens to "bet" on bins (or ranges) on what you expect a
            given person&apos;s outcome to be. The outcome you will be asked to
            predict is either their income or reported health.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make an informed "best guess" estimate afterwards for the exact
            value of their score on their self-reported score.
          </li>

          <li>
            You will get a base payment for completion of the survey, and a
            bonus payment for each profile you look at based on the accuracy of
            your predictions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pro-Tip: A good strategy for wagering with your 30 tokens is to
            imagine 30 different hypothetical worlds. Place tokens according to
            the number of worlds where you would reasonably expect their outcome
            to lie in one of the given ranges.{" "}

        </ol>

                You will receive bonus points based on how close your best guess
                is to the actual value of the outcome for the profile you are
                making predictions about, where you receive less and less the
                further your guess is from the truth, where the bonus is equal
                to the following “squared loss” formula:
