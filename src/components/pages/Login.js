                <h4>Risks and discomfort:</h4> The primary risk associated with
                this study is a possible invasion of your privacy. Though every
                reasonable effort has been taken, confidentiality during actual
                Internet communication procedures cannot be guaranteed.

                tournament a useful introspective exercise.

                background survey and prediction tournament. You will also
                receive up to $0.05 for each of the 30 profiles you are asked to
                make predictions about, based on the accuracy of your
                predictions. You will receive at least $0.50 for completing the
                study and could earn up to $1.50 in bonus payments.
